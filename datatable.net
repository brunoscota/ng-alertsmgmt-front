NPM is the package manager that ships with the popular Node.JS framework and is used extensively for both client-side and server-side packages.

Install
Use the following to install the selected software in your package:

npm install --save jszip
npm install --save datatables.net-bs4
npm install --save datatables.net-buttons-bs4
npm install --save datatables.net-responsive-bs4


Module require
To be able to use the selected software in your package, use the following code:

require( 'jszip' );
require( 'datatables.net-bs4' )();
require( 'datatables.net-buttons-bs4' )();
require( 'datatables.net-buttons/js/buttons.html5.js' )();
require( 'datatables.net-responsive-bs4' )();
When used with CommonJS, the DataTables packages all export a factory function that can be executed with two optional arguments (shown without above):

The window object to use (this is require as jQuery in a headless CommonJS environment can require a window with a document attached). If no parameter is given, or it is falsy, window will be used.
The jQuery object that DataTables should be attached to. If no parameter is given, the package will do its own require('jquery') to include jQuery.
For example if you wish to use your own `window` and `jQuery` parameters:

Javascript

var $  = require( 'jquery' );
var dt = require( 'datatables.net' )( window, $ );
Please note that the above is shown for CommonJS modules. If you are using an AMD loader, you do not need to execute the required library (i.e. remove the trailing ()).
